Description and links to the datasets used
- (Alice) This dataset includes various facilities in Pittsburgh, including pools. It includes the neighborhood associated with each facility: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-facilities 
- (Salimat) For my data visualization, I organized my dataset by separating the lowest 5 neighborhoods by the top 5 neighborhoods to have a kid in. I also sorted the bar graph by how many enrollment students, which will determine the best neighborhood school to enroll a kid in.

- (Dorothy) The relevant information I used was the frequency of neighborhood names within the data set. In the set, it names all the different playgrounds, their street address, corresponding neighborhoods, and other information related to maintenance of said parks.
